                        <p>My conversion story isn't complicated. It's not mind-blowing. It's not outstanding. But it's mine.</p>
                        <p>As a child I was raised in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. My parents have always been faithful examples to me and tried to teach me the best they could.</p>
                        <p>I remember that sometimes I wouldn't want to go to church. I wanted to stay home and watch a Star Wars movie, or play video games with my friends. Classic activities for a young boy growing up, yet my parents always brought me to church. It took me a while to understand why.</p>
                        <p>I think my first significant spiritual experience about prioritizing church came much later. I was in high school on a club volleyball team. Sometimes we would play on Sundays, which meant not being able to go to church. I noticed that there was always a gaping hole the weeks following those Sundays. I missed eating the bread and drinking the water that symbolized Jesus Christ's infinite sacrifice that He gave for me.</p>
                        <p>Small, seemingly insignificant spiritual experiences throughout my childhood have led me to where I am today. Not only do I now understand why we do the things we do in the Church of Jesus Christ, but I have a desire to do them. I know that there's a reason for every commandment, every policy. I know why I stand as a member of Jesus Christ's church today.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">The Book of Mormon</h2>
                        <p>I always grew up reading stories from The Book of Mormon. By my senior year in high school, I'd read it several times through and believed it was true. In the spring towards the end of the school year, I decided that over the summer I would read it one more time and decide whether or not I <i>knew</i> it was true.</p>
                        <p>Over the summer I worked a full-time job at Valley Precast, a local precast business. On my way to work every morning, I listened to The Book of Mormon. Sometimes I would additionally read it in my own time. Eventually I got to the final chapter where Moroni, one of the prophets and authors of the Book of Mormon, leaves a special invitation to all who read it. The verses read:</p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">"3 Behold, I would exhort you that when ye shall read these things, if it be wisdom in God that ye should read them, that ye would remember how merciful the Lord hath been unto the children of men, from the creation of Adam even down until the time that ye shall receive these things, and ponder it in your hearts.
                            <p>4 And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.</p>
                            <p>5 And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things."</p></blockquote>
                        <p>That night I went home and thought about what I head read and listened to. I sincerely prayed, asking Heavenly Father if the things that I had read were true. I distinctly remember having a thought come to my head that wasn't mine that told me exactly what I needed to hear. The voice said, "You've always known these things are true."</p>
                        <p>I never had any serious doubts about the Book of Mormon, and that experience helped to confirm that what I believed was true. I then knew and know now that the Book of Mormon is true and testifies of Jesus Christ and Heavenly Father and the roles They share in bringing about our eternal happiness.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Continuing Forward in Faith</h2>
                        <p>It's not always easy believing the things I do as a member of the Church of Jesus Christ. Sometimes people wrongfully misunderstand my intentions or mistakenly criticize me for the things I believe, not knowing the full story. Each day is a choice, and one that I consciously make knowing the things that I know.</p>
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/post-sample-image.jpg" alt="..." />
                        <span class="caption text-muted">The knowledge that I can be with my family forever, no matter what happens to us in this life, brings me comfort.</span>
                        <p>However, I know that striving to live by the precepts of The Book of Mormon and exercising faith in Jesus Christ, I have experienced more joy than I possibly could otherwise. The knowledge that I can be with my family forever, no matter what happens to us in this life, brings me comfort.</p>
                        <p>I know that Jesus Christ is my Savior. I know He inspired prophets to write The Book of Mormon, and alongside God the Father, He appeared to Joseph Smith in 1820 to call him as another prophet, one who would translate the ancient records of the Book of Mormon to English for all of us to be able to learn of those experiences and apply the teachings to ourselves.</p>
